# releasify

A CLI tool to simplify your release process!

**Important note**:
This tool simplify a process, if you don't have one, it is the right time to adopt one!

## The Release Process with `releasify`

This is what you can archive with this tool to release your module:

1. You want to release your `awesome-module`
1. Go to the local directory an checkout the branch you want to release
1. Execute `releasify publish` (see the [examples](#Publish)) and the tool will:
  1. checks that your local repo is aligned with your git remote
  1. updates the version of your `package.json`
  1. publishes the module in your `npm` registry using your default settings
  1. commit&push the bumped version to your remote
  1. creates a GitHub release with a CHANGELOG description and appling a tag with the same version of the `package.json`
1. A new version of your module is now published! ðŸŽ‰

### â˜„ Publish

You need a [GitHub OAUTH Token][gh-token] with scope `repo:public_repo` to run this command.

```sh
releasify publish [--path|-p <path>]             âž¡ The path to the project to release. Default `pwd`
                  [--tag|-t <pattern>]           âž¡ The pattern of the tag to release. Useful for multi-branch project. It is necessary to find the last tag released of that pipeline. Default `v${major version of the project}.\d+.\d+`
                  [--semver|-s <release>]        âž¡ Force the release type. The value must be [major, premajor, minor, preminor, patch, prepatch, prerelease]
                  [--verbose|-v <level>]         âž¡ Print out more info. The value must be [debug, info, warn, error]. Default `warn`
                  [--remote|-r <string>]         âž¡ The remote git where push the bumped version. Useful if you are releasing. Default `origin`
                  [--branch|-b <string>]         âž¡ The branch you want to release. Useful when you need to release a multi-branch module. Default `master`
                  [--no-verify|-n]               âž¡ Add the `--no-verify` to the commit, useful for slow test you don't need to run in case of bump
                  [--gh-token|-k <env | token>]  âž¡ The GitHub OAUTH token. You can set it with an env var name or a valid token. Default env var `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`
                  [--gh-release-edit|-e]         âž¡ Open an editor to modify the release message before creating it on GitHub
                  [--gh-release-draft]           âž¡ Create the GitHub Release as draft. Default `false`
                  [--gh-release-prerelease]      âž¡ Create the GitHub Release as pre-release. Default `false`
                  [--npm-access|-a <string>]     âž¡ It will set the --access flag of `npm publish` command. Useful for scoped modules. The value must be [public, restricted]
                  [--npm-dist-tag <string>]      âž¡ It will add a npm tag to the module, like `beta` or `next`
                  [--npm-otp <code>]             âž¡ It will provide the otp code to the npm publish
                  [--major|-m]                   âž¡ It will unlock the release of a major release
                  [--help|-h]                    âž¡ Show this help message
```

#### Examples

Release minor of "your-module" with 2FA on npm and customizing the GitHub release message:

```sh
export MY_ENV_OAUTH_KEY 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
cd /your-module
releasify publish -v debug -s minor -k MY_ENV_OAUTH_KEY -e --npm-otp 123456
```
---

Release a patch of your "mod" in the branch `1.x`, assuming disabled 2FA on npm and the OAUTH token in env as `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`


```sh
releasify publish -p ./mod -b 1.x -t v1.* -v debug -s patch
```

Explanation:
+ `-b`: it will check that your local repository is in the right branch and it will be used in the bump phase
+ `-t`: it will be used to explore the git history to find the commit messages. This is necessary when your tag name pattern doesn't follow the `v<semver-version>` pattern. By default the value of this parameter is `v${major version read from package.json}*`


### â˜„ Draft

Print out the new version that should be released with its changelog listing the commit messages.

The commits shown are
+ from: the `HEAD` of your local project 
+ to: the _first commit_ or the _last version tag_ you created

Moreover, if the commit message is written with the pattern: `text describing (#123)`, where
`(#123)` is the pull request ID, the labels of that PR are downloaded and processed by the template
engine. These info are fetched from GitHub, keep in mind that there are [rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting).

```sh
releasify draft [--path|-p <path>]        âž¡ The path to the project to draft. Default `pwd`
                [--tag|-t <pattern>]      âž¡ The pattern of the tag to draft. Useful for multi-branch project. Default `v${major version of the project}.\d+.\d+`
                [--from-commit <hash>]    âž¡ Specify a commit hash where to start to generate the release message. Default `HEAD`
                [--to-commit <hash>]      âž¡ Specify a commit hash where to stop to generate the release message. The --tag arg will be ignored
                [--semver|-s <release>]   âž¡ Force the release type. The value must be [major, premajor, minor, preminor, patch, prepatch, prerelease]
                [--verbose|-v <level>]    âž¡ Print out more info. The value must be [debug, info, warn, error]
                [--help|-h]               âž¡ Show this help message
```

Build release messages between old commits in order to create a changelog if you don't have one:

```sh
releasify draft --from-commit 93c914beb07eede9635d1234c20cff0e41f093a1 --to-commit 8797fc32812fb988957145877429aa937af292f1
